# How does COVID-19Net work?
The COVID-19Net application checks for updates to the numbers related to COVID-19 (Corona virus) so that you can track and keep up to date with these numbers.

As it is data retrieved through an API, it allows you to save the .JSON file if you want to use it, and to do some data processing with this information.
